Grocery Item Tracker Project

The purpose of this project was to read in a list of items, and to create a map of the item name along with the number of times the item was in the list. Then the program sends the map to a file in the form of the item name, a space, the quantity of the item, and a new line. The program gives the user the option to display the results as a number, a histogram, to search for a particular item, or to quit the program.

I really like the use of getch in the program to get the char. It makes it so you don't have to hit enter, and reduces the amount of errors that can occur by only taking 1 char.

One thing I would change is I would probably add another header and cpp file to the program for the additional functions I created that didn't really fit into the class file.

The most challenging part of writing this was the parts with the pointers to memory locations. Had to go back and look at reference material a few times and look at some different code before I got it to work correctly. Google always helps too.

Everything from this project will definetly be transferable to other projects, but the work with pointers, and reading in and outputting a file will be especially useful.

Tried to keep the code seperated into functions and a class as much as possible. This helps to keep it maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
